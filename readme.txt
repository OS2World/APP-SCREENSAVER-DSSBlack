DISCLAIMER: 
I'm not responsible for any damage caused by using this software or unability 
to use it.

DESCRIPTION:
This module can be useful if you use Doodle Screen Saver and can't utilize 
DPMS support of SNAP driver. It turns off the monitor by direct access to VGA 
registers. In fact it is a small modification of old BLACK screen saver by 
Staffan Ulfberg.

USAGE:
To use it copy black.dll to the Modules subdirectory of Doodle Screen Saver
and select the module. Make sure DPMS usage in the Doodle Screen Saver itself
is turned off (otherwise I don't know what is going to happend :)
